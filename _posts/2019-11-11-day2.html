<h2 class="section-heading">Dear Diary Section</h2>

<p>
    The fire of excitement is still burning inside of me. Today I trained my chest and shoulders. For some strange reason, I couldn't lift much weight for seated over head press today. 
    It maybe because I didn't take enough rest time between sets. I don't know. Anyway, I was wrong about my legs (See day 1 for reference). They have started to hurt. But as they say, no pain, no gain. 
    I got late for the gym today (again). I really need to wake up early from now on. What else? Umm... I tried apple cider vinegar for the first time. I didn't find it as bad as I thought it would taste. 
    Apparently, it shouldn't be taken before sleeping as it may disrupt your sleep. But I took it anyway (I AM A DAREDEVIL). I did wake up once in the middle of the night, but I am sure it was not because of apple cider vinegar (I had a horrible nightmare, the usual kind I have).
    So, another myth busted. You can drink apple cider vinegar before sleeping.
