Voila! This is my first blog entry. Welcome humble readers. I am really excited about this blog. 
I am well aware that this blog is going to get very few views and there is absolutely no monetary aspect to it. But still, this would be a fun writing experience.   
</p>

<p>
This blog entry is going to give a brief on what the fitness log entries are going to be about. It should be noted here that the fitness log entries are going to be different from fitness entries.
The fitness log entries are going to be my daily log on what muscle did I train in the gym, what kind of diet I had throughout the day, how I felt working out, my progress etc. On the other hand, the fitness entries
are going to be my general learnings and thoughts on body fitness. 
</p>

<p>
    So, what is fitness log? Well, I have started taking personal fitness coaching from Mr. Arshdeep Singh via the <a href='https://www.getfittr.com/'>Fittr android app.</a>. I am going to be logging my daily progress including my workout 
    and my diet for the day for the next 3 months (excluding Sundays). I will also be attaching a shirtless photograph of me so that I can document the progress visually. 
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
        Disclaimer: Physically ugly human being in his early 20s is going to be attaching his shirtless picture in every fitness log. Viewer's discretion is advised. If you are going to deepfake my picture, 
        just give me credits.
        I have no self-esteem. Also, feel free to meme my pictures.
    </blockquote>

    Coming to why this blog? I am writing this to document my fitness journey so that hopefully I'll motivate some other people to start working out as well and feel more confident. I am not sure if physically being beautiful 
    help in boosting self confidence, but I guess we'll find out. Further, writing these entries will also help me in keeping a track of how my body reacts to different diet and workout types. Finally, documenting everything 
    will hopefully motivate me to achieve my fitness goal. 
</p>

<p>
    Next, how this blog? The blog will be divided into three sections; the dear diary, the workout and the diet sections. The dear diary section would consist of just me putting my random thoughts on the workout for that day.
    The workout section would be a sort of table with the exercises that I did that day. This table would include the exercise name, reps performed and the weight lifted during the exercise. Finally, the diet section 
    will consist of my diet for the day.

<h2 class="section-heading">A brief about me</h2>

<p>
    My name is Bojack horseman and I am dead inside. Just kidding, my name is bunty from the bunty and bubly fame. Anyway, you don't really care what my name is. So, down to details.
    <ul>
            <li>Sex: Male</li>
            <li>Age: 24</li>
            <li>Height: 5'10''</li>
            <li>Weight: 74.2</li>
            <li>Body fat: 24.2%</li>
            <li>Waist: 35</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    My ultimate fitness goal is to reduce the body fat to 10% and gain some muscles and weight in the process. Sounds like a paradox? Welcome to my life. 
</p>

<p>
    I hope this gave you a fairly good idea about the fitness logging aspect of my blog and of course, I hope you had a decent time reading it. Adios! Till next time :)
