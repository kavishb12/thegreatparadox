# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  The purpose of the existance of this blog is to serve as my personal extempore diary entry. This is a one-stop place for your daily fix of honesty. 
  The tone of the blog will be simiilar to how Jack kerouac (fame of On the road) writes. As the title of this blog suggests, this blog is a glimpse of 
  how my grey cells react to everyday life. Yes you guessed this right, this blog is my therapy outlet and only I am allowed to have the teddy in the circle. 
  I will be writing about everything from technology, privacy, mental health, monolouges about life to fitness.
