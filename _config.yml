  The purpose of the existance of this blog is to serve as my personal extempore diary entry. This is a one-stop place for your daily fix of honesty. 
  The tone of the blog will be simiilar to how Jack kerouac (fame of On the road) writes. As the title of this blog suggests, this blog is a glimpse of 
  how my grey cells react to everyday life. Yes you guessed this right, this blog is my therapy outlet and only I am allowed to have the teddy in the circle. 
  I will be writing about everything from technology, privacy, mental health, monolouges about life to fitness.
